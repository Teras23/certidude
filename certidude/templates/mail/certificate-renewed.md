Renewed {{ common_name }} ({{ cert_serial_hex }})

This is simply to notify that certificate for {{ common_name }}
was renewed and the serial number of the new certificate is {{ cert_serial_hex }}.

The new certificate is valid from {{ builder.begin_date }} until
{{ builder.end_date }}.

Services making use of those certificates should continue working as expected.
